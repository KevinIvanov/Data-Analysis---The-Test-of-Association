# Data Analysis: Test of Association 📊

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project delves into the potential connections between the level of stress and home environments among university students. Using chi-square tests of independence, we aim to uncover whether the space where students live influences their stress levels.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employ the Chi-Square Test of Independence to evaluate associations between two categorical variables—students' stress levels and their home environments.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize ggplot2 in R to create insightful visualizations, portraying the distribution of stress levels across various home environments.

## 🔍 Methods Used
- **Chi-Square Test of Independence**: This test helps in determining if there is a statistically significant association between two categorical variables.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Leveraging R and the ggplot2 library, the project offers visual insights into the data, making it easier to spot trends and patterns.

## 📈 Results
- The analysis revealed no significant association between students' home environments and their levels of stress. This suggests that variations observed may be attributable to random differences rather than systematic influences.

## 📝 Conclusions
The insights from this study indicate that the stress levels among students at the Pacific University are not significantly impacted by their home environments. These findings offer a valuable perspective on the factors that might influence student well-being.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
Ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:
- **Software**: R and RStudio.
